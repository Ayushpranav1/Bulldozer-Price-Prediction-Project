# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction-Project
This project employs machine learning to predict bulldozer selling prices, crucial for construction businesses in informed equipment decisions. The dataset includes diverse bulldozer attributes and auction history.

## Dataset
The Bulldozer Price Dataset is a collection of records containing information about bulldozers, such as its age, usage, size, and configuration. It also includes the sale price of each bulldozer. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Model
The machine learning model for bulldozer price prediction is constructed using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, which is an ensemble learning technique combining multiple decision trees for predictions. Known for its effectiveness in handling non-linear relationships and robustness against overfitting, the model is trained on features from the Bulldozer Price Dataset and their respective sale prices. Throughout training, the algorithm learns data patterns, ensuring accurate predictions.

## Usage
To employ the trained model for bulldozer price prediction, adhere to the following instructions:

* Verify the installation of Python and the necessary libraries.
* Organize input data, incorporating pertinent features of a bulldozer.
* Utilize the model's predict function to acquire the forecasted price based on the provided input data.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using diverse evaluation metrics, including the RMSLE (root mean squared log error). These metrics aid in assessing the precision and accuracy of the model's predictions.
